              My experience includes building a React/Redux-Saga e-commerce
              platform driving $1M+ in monthly revenue, re-architected two
              legacy stores into a unified Spring Boot/Node.js solution serving
              100K+ users daily, and designed fault-tolerant integrations with
              Kafka, IBM MQ, and OMS.

              Beyond work, Iâ€™ve tackled projects from an Amazon clone
              (Next.js/Tailwind) to AI-driven tools like a LangChain/Neo4j
              chatbot for clinical documents and a PyTorch-based vision agent
              for Supertux hockey. My tech stack spans front-end, back-end, and
              machine learning, enabling me to build seamless, scalable
              solutions with React, Next.js, TailwindCSS, Spring Boot, Node.js,
              Kafka, Python (PyTorch/OpenCV), and modern CI/CD. I thrive on
              clean abstractions, end-to-end ownership, and iterating toward
              intuitive user experiences.
